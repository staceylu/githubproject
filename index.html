      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>I have been playing around with code for the past few years. I started back in the myspace days, but I didn't dive really deep. I started really getting interesting in coding when I saw that there weren't many solutions for my niche. Always having to customize and piece together the things I needed for my website, I decided to learn more. I found that I really enjoyed coming up with solutions for my problems.</p>

      <h2>Why I Decided to Learn Programming</h2>
      <p>I decided to learn programming because I liked working on my website and I liked solving problems. There was something fun about acccidentally breaking my website and then trying to figure out how to fix it while still trying to accomplish the goal I was trying to reach to begin with. </p>
